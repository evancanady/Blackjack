# Blackjack
 a simple Balckjack model to test game hypotheses

 _I'm trying to keep track of new ideas in the wiki._

 This idea came out of a comment I heard someone make about being annoyed with another Blackjack player at his table. This other payer hit when he was showing 17 (generally a bad strategy) and thereby took the card from the next player. This seems illogical, but I thought it would be fun to simulate thousands of game where I can give players various stratagies or playing styles and see if there is any impact to the table's success.

 The eventual goal is to be able to simulate 1000's of games, record the results, and look for patterns.
